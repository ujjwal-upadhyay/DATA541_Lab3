# Markdown
***
The Markdown syntax is a way of **structing** documents and providing styling without having to use **HTML** or **Cascading Style Sheets.** The name is a play on the term *markup*, which is the process of preparing documents for printing through the process of editing and layout.

# Features of GitHub Markdown

# Common GitHub Markdown Text Directives
Directive | Use | Example
| :-- | :-- | :--
| + | Italic | *Italic*
| ++ | Bold | **Bold**
| ~~ | Strikethrough | ~~Strikethrough~~
| `` | Command | `Command`
| \ | Escape Characters | \*Two asterics\*

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character.

`Let's rename \*our-new-project\+ to \*our-old-project\*.`
